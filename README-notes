 Compiling and Installing Netgen version 1.5

    Netgen 1.5 is distribution code. Compiled without the Tcl interface (not recommended), 
    it should compile and run like the original version (which had no version number). 
    However, the "make" process has been substantially cleaned up, and converted to GNU autoconf. 
    The Tcl version of Netgen compiles and runs by default. The Tcl version takes advantage 
    of both the ability to script the simulation procedure, including some scripts to ease 
    the complicated process of LVS by reducing most cases to a one-line command. The compilation 
    procedure should be immediately recognizable to anyone familiar with GNU autoconf:

        ./configure
        make
        make install 

    The main prerequisite for netgen is Tcl/Tk. Currently (2017), this means Tcl/Tk version 8.6. 
    For OS versions with packaging systems (e.g., "yum" or "apt-get", etc.), be sure to install 
    the development version of Tcl/Tk, which usually has package names of "tcl-devel" and "tk-devel", 
    respectively, although the names may vary according to the packaging system.
